# SkelbiuFetcher
Second hand item website skelbiu.lt scraper for new items.
Educational purposes only.

**Dependencies:**
- Selenium
- playsound
- beaupy

**Why not beautifulpanda, but Selenium?**
-- beautifulpanda library gets caught by captchas, Selenium doesn't.

**Why terminal-based instead of UI?**
-- UI is being planned in the future.

**Are there gonna be more second-hand websites added?**
-- Vinted and Facebook marketplace are planned to be added in the future.

To-do
- [ ] Implement OOP principles / refactor code for easier readability.
- [ ] Profitability counting formula for each new item.
